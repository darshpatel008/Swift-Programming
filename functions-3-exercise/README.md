## Functions Part 3 Exercise

# Instructions

Using what you have learnt about functions which can have outputs, create a function called `isOdd(n: Int)`.

For any given whole number passed to the function, e.g.

`isOdd(n: 5)`

The function will test to see if the number is odd. If it is, then it should output true otherwise it should output false. These are Booleans and not Strings. 

Without changing any of the existing code, your function should be able to output the result.

Try out your code in the main.swift file. 

### Note

You should not write any print statements. The tests will only pass if the result is an output. 

### Hint

You can use the [remainder operator](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html#ID64) to check if something can be cleanly divided.
