## Loops Exercise

# Instructions

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers that is created by adding the 2 previous numbers.

e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

The first 2 numbers are always 0 and 1. 

The 3rd number is calculated like so:

0 + 1 = 1

The 4th number is calculated like so:

1 + 1 = 2

etc.

Create a function that prints out the Fibonacci sequence as an array for the specified number of digits.

e.g. Calling `fibonacci(n: 5)` should print:
```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```
But calling `fibonacci(n: 10)` should print:
```
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
You can test your code in the main.swift or an Xcode Swift Playground.
